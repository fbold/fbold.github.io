          is a platform I am currently working on that aims to deliver improved
          virtual invitations for any occasion by taking full advantage of the

          database, all containerized with docker and hosted on VPS with CI/CD
          using GH Actions and using Stripe as a payment processor.

          is a personal project I am working on. It's a minimal writing platform
          that uses the TipTap editor for writing and has a lot of custom CSS.
          While it's not designed it in mind, it will work on mobile. It's more
          of a platform entirely for me to use to write, so it is less concerned
          with UX.
          <br />
          <br />
          It uses iron-session for auth, but I didn't want to use any emails, I
          wanted classic username+password auth. To make recovery possible and
          increase security, I implemented a 12-word mnemonic recovery system
          which you can see when creating a new account.
          <br />
          <br />
          Please not as this is still an in development platform, any data and
          accounts might be removed before release.
